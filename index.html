  <p><strong>Hello, my name is Michael Ngo. I am currently taking this course because of a profound interest in web development.
  Several of my hobbies include playing video games, guitar, learning about personal finance, and watching anime. I love
  dogs,
  especially pomapoos and huskies. I also love good food. The key to my heart is a place with good ambience and savory
  food.</strong></p>
